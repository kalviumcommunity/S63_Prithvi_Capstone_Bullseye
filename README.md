Project Brief â€“ Bullseye ðŸŽ¯
Bullseye â€“ Straight to the point, just like a perfect shot.
This project is a Virtual Sports Training & Analytics Platform specifically designed for shooting sports. Bullseye helps shooters track their training, analyze performance, and connect with the community. The platform will provide session tracking, training drills, reaction time testing, and virtual competitions, all within a user-friendly and minimal tech stack.
With Bullseye, shooters can monitor their accuracy, shooting streaks, ammo consumption, and training progress while engaging with a community of fellow athletes and coaches. The platform aims to enhance training efficiency, improve shooting skills, and create a collaborative space for shooters of all levels.

Key Features
Shooting Training & Analytics
âœ… Shooting Session Tracker â€“ Logs session duration, shots fired, scores, and uploaded target images for progress tracking.
 âœ… Holding Timer â€“ Customizable hold/rest timer for dumbbell exercises to improve arm strength.
 âœ… Auto-Scoring from Target Images â€“ Uses image processing to extract scores from uploaded target images.
 âœ… Ammo Consumption Tracker â€“ Logs bullets used per session and estimates future needs.
 âœ… Shooting Streak Counter â€“ Tracks consistent training days (e.g., "You've trained for 5 consecutive days!").
 âœ… Data Export â€“ Allows users to download their shooting history and analytics as PDF or CSV.
 âœ… Wind & Weather Tracking â€“ Logs weather conditions for outdoor shooting analysis.
Shooter Training & Community Engagement (OPTIONAL)
âœ… Personalized Training Plans â€“ Users can set goals (accuracy, speed, endurance) and get training recommendations.
 âœ… Coach Feedback System â€“ Allows shooters to upload videos for professional review and feedback.
 âœ… Drill Randomizer â€“ Generates random training drills to keep practice engaging.
 âœ… Voice Commands & Audio Cues â€“ Enables hands-free interaction (e.g., "Start session," "Stop timer").
 âœ… Reaction Time Trainer â€“ A beeping system for 25m air pistol shooting, where shooters must fire between two beeps.
 âœ… Virtual Competition Mode â€“ Users can participate in virtual challenges with real-time score updates.
Community & Events
âœ… Shooter Collaboration Challenges â€“ Community-based challenges (e.g., "Best 5-shot group this week").
 âœ… Event Calendar for Shooting Tournaments â€“ Lists upcoming shooting events, both online and offline.
 âœ… Community Platform â€“ Enables shooters to share achievements and connect with academies and coaches.
Additional Utilities
âœ… Firearm Maintenance Log â€“ Track when firearms were last cleaned or serviced.
âœ… Customizable UI Themes â€“ Dark mode, high-contrast mode for better usability.
